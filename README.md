The corpus is a collection of male and female Hip Hop/Rap songs of the past 2 decades. I chose this corpus, because it contains songs of popular Hip Hop/Rap artists. The interesting about this corpus is that it includes popular male and female artists of not only today, but also from the last 2 decades, so the a majority of the songs should be recognizable for hip hop listeners above 18.
The natural comparison points in the corpus are going to be: speechiness(expectation is that male rap songs are going to have a higher value on average), danceability(expectation is that female rap songs are going to have a higher value on average), tempo, valence, energy.

Plot description:

The plot shows the male vs female rap songs, when it comes to the speechiness vs danceability of the songs. This plot is interesting, because it reinforces the hypothesis that the female rap songs have a hugher danceability.
